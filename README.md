# Fire Flies :notes:

### Context
Game developed with a friend during a day we decided to make something fun. 

I took care of the programming and Unity stuff, he was responsible for the Assets.

### Description
The idea of the game is to catch notes at the rythm of the music "Fire Flies" by Gorillaz. We inspired ourselves in Guitar Hero games.

The notes are circles that converge in the center of the screen and you have a ring where they must be clicked. Near the center there is an area for extra points.

The game has 3 phases, with increasing difficulty.
